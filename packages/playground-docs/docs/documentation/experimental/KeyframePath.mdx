> This component is an experiment and might never be finished.

`KeyframePath` is a component that allows you to display a path of keyframes that can be moved around and edited.
A keyframe is an object with a position and a time. The position is relative to the parent element of the keyframe path.
The time is a number that can be used to interpolate between keyframes.
The interpolation is `linear` by default but can be changed to a `bezier curve`.

If the `enableBezier` prop is set to `true`, the user can move the bezier handles of the keyframes
and change the interpolation type to `bezier` by double-clicking on the keyframe.

## Examples

<Example name="KeyframePath" />

## API

### KeyframePath Props

<Properties component="KeyframePath" />

### Keyframe Type

```ts
type Keyframe = {
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  time: number;
  interpolation?: Interpolation;
};
```

&nbsp;

> Note that `interpolation` is optional and defaults to `linear`.

### Interpolation Type

```ts
type LinearInterpolation = {
  type: "linear";
};

type BezierInterpolation = {
  type: "bezier";
  p1: { x: number; y: number };
  p2: { x: number; y: number };
};

type Interpolation = LinearInterpolation | BezierInterpolation;
```
