The theme is a set of colors, sizes and fonts that are used throughout the application. It can be enabled through the `ThemeProvider` component.

## Usage

### Enabling the theme

Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` component.

```tsx
export const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <MyApp />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

The provider will wrap you application in a class `light` or `dark` depending on the theme type. You can use this class to style your application.
It will also define the css variables that will be used to style your application.

The default theme type is `system`. This means that the theme type will be set to `dark` if the user has enabled dark mode in their operating system.

### Defining the theme configuration

The `ThemeProvider` component accepts a `configuration` prop. This prop is used to define the theme configuration.

## Reference

### \{:component} ThemeProvider

The `ThemeProvider` component is used to enable the theme. It will make the theme available to all components that use the `useTheme` hook.

```tsx
<ThemeProvider>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

### \{:function} useTheme

The `useTheme` hook is used to access the theme. It returns an object with the following properties:

- `themeType`: The current theme type. Can be either `light`, `dark` or `system`.
- `theme`: The current theme. Can be either `light` or `dark`.
- `setTheme`: A function to set the theme type. It accepts a single argument, the theme type.
- `configuration`: The current theme configuration. This is the configuration that is used to generate the theme.

```tsx
const { themeType, theme, setTheme, configuration } = useTheme();
```

### \{:type} ThemeConfiguration

The `ThemeConfiguration` type is used to define the theme configuration.

```ts
type ThemeConfiguration = {
  colors: ThemeConfigurationColors;
  sizes: {
    padding: ThemeConfigurationPadding;
    borderRadius: ThemeConfigurationBorderRadius;
    fontSize: ThemeConfigurationFontSizes;
  };
};
```

### \{:type} ThemeConfigurationColors

The `ThemeConfigurationColors` type is used to define the colors of the theme. It accepts two properties, `light` and `dark`. Each of these properties is an object that defines the colors for the theme type.

```ts
type ThemeConfigurationColors = {
  light: ThemeConfigurationColorsBase;
  dark: ThemeConfigurationColorsBase;
};
```
