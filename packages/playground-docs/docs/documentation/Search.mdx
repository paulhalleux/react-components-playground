`Selector` is a component that allows you to select elements in a container.
It works like a lasso tool, where you click and drag to select elements.

## Example

<Example name="Selector" />

## API

### Selector Props

<Properties properties={[
  { name: "parentRef", type: "React.RefObject<HTMLElement>", description: "The parent element to select elements in.", required: true },
  { name: "color", type: "[number, number, number]", description: "The color of the selector." },
  { name: "children", type: "React.ReactNode", description: "The elements to select." },
]} />
