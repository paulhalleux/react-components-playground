`FrameSelector` is a component to select a frame (size and position) in a container.
It can be used to crop an image or to select a region of interest.

The component has multiple handles that can be used to resize the frame.
The frame can be moved by dragging the center of the frame.

It also accepts a `children` prop that will be rendered inside the frame. In the example below, we use the `CrossHead` component to render a cross inside the frame.
